            <h2>Flash, Java, and other RTEs (run-time environments)</h2>
            <p>
                 A run-time environment is a stand-alone software (a.k.a plug-in) 
                 that displays a non-standard file type in a browser. For example, 
                 browsers can't display PDFs without a PDF viewer plug-in). For decades Flash was 
                 the standard for animation on the web. But browsers couldn't display its .swf file-type 
                 without the FlashPlayer.
            </p>
            <p>
                RTEs add capabilities beyond those of a browser, and therefore have been 
                prohibited from iOS devices. While Flash received the bulk of attention when Apple 
                refused to allow RTEs on iPhones, all run-times —except their own QuickTime— were banned, 
                since they could bypass Apple's AppStore (The notion that RTEs hog memory or are more prone 
                to bugs was a red herring; Apple didn't want to miss out on AppStore revenue).

                Examples of popular RTEs include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adobe Flash*</li>
                <li>Adobe AIR</li>
                <li>Adobe Reader</li>
                <li>Java (not to be confused with JavaScript)</li>
                <li>Microsoft Silverlight*</li>
                <li>Apple QuickTime</li>
            </ul>
